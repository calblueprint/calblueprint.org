# Blueprint: Contract and Terms of Work

_Last updated: June 2021_

This document serves as a repository for Blueprint's general terms of work with its nonprofit partners. It should set the expectations for Blueprint's **specialization of work**, **development cycle**, and **work contract**, so you can see if your organization is a good fit for Blueprint's services. Once an organization is selected to work with Blueprint, a customized version of this contract, along with all details of the project deliverables, will be signed by both parties.

## Specialization of Work

Our projects require a large time investment for our developers (see the next section, "Timeline"), and our commitment towards your organization's success is proportionally grand. The type of project that we look for is one that will enable your organization to scale and achieve a level of operation otherwise unreachable without the assistance of our technology. It does not matter how big or small you are already--**if you believe that we can help you create meaningful change, pitch us your idea**.

### Examples of Accepted Projects

- A mobile app for navigating and troubleshooting a solar powered suitcase used by midwives in rural areas. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSQ_DumV0ErS2wzg12aCCsSVFWQ8n27MDkkTRks44BnkO_136Y71g3D0CZsDT08YeDg9gEX__YUPwgd/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.gd5b9544fd1_0_89" target="_blank">See We Care Solar →</a>
- A web portal for Black, LGBTQ+/SGL, and other marginalized communities to find and connect with organizations nationwide. [See National Black Justice Coalition →](http://nbjc-staging.herokuapp.com/)
- A customer rewards program and store locator mobile app ([see it on the App Store](https://tiny.cc/HealthyCornersApp)) to increase access to affordable healthy food in DC's food deserts through DC Central Kitchen's Healthy Corners stores. [See DC Central Kitchen →](https://calblueprint.org/projects/dckitchen)
- And [more of our past projects](https://calblueprint.org/projects)

**Examples of projects that will NOT be accepted:** Redesigning a static website, refactoring old codebases to use newer technology, creating a mobile app "version" of already existing technology that is already effectively solving the problem.

### Technology

Blueprint's developers have created many kinds of software. We specialize in **web application and mobile application development**, but these are by no means strict limitations. We are eager to hear your proposals.

For the tech savvy, our projects usually run on a [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) frontend. Recently, we've also started to use [Airtable](https://airtable.com) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), and  as a backend for some of our web and mobile apps. This past year, we've had success building web apps using a combination of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

## Timeline and Development Cycle

We are based at the University of California, Berkeley, and our developers are all students attending the university. We ask you to be cognizant of our development cycle, which is closely tied our semesterly system of recruitment and breaks.

### Timeline

_Exact dates may vary slightly._

**Week 1 — September 8th**

We have recruited all designers and developers for the semester. They are introduced to their respective project teams.

**Week 4 — September 30th**

Developers, designers and the project leader finalize project scoping and create the final contract of work between Blueprint and the nonprofit, signed by both parties. Digital prototype has been designed and approved, and tickets for feature development are underway.

Note: When both parties agree to this project proposal, it should be agreed upon and set unless in otherwise unforeseen circumstances. There may be pivots or revalued features, but not a revamp that fundamentally changes the purpose and/or mission of what we are trying to achieve.

**Week 8 — October 20th**

First-quarter check-in. Project team and the nonprofit meet (either in-person or remotely) to check-in to peer into design and development progress.

**Week 14 — December 1st**

Midpoint check-in: project team and the nonprofit meet to check-in. The minimum viable product (MVP) should be mostly complete.

**Week 16-21 — December 14th - January 21st**

Project team remains on university break during this period.

**Week 23 — February 3rd**

Blueprint recruits new members to fill in project team members that have graduated. Design and development resume.

**Week 30 — March 25th**

Third-quarter check-in: developers, project leader, and the nonprofit meet to check-in. Any final feature adjustments and refinements **should be made at this point.**

**Week 38 — May 6th - 20th**

Project team meet at the NPO's office to give a live presentation and hand off final product. If this is not possible it will be held remotely.

### Communication

Project teams and their nonprofits will try to meet every other week to give brief status updates and answer any questions. More in-depth check-ins will be held quarterly over the entire development cycle. We want to have as open of a communication channel as possible, so we will always be open via email or phone to answer any questions or concerns.

## Cost

Blueprint's services are offered **completely pro bono**. Our developers are highly-skilled individuals who have had experience working at Silicon Valley's leading tech companies, but we're also students who share a concern for improving our community. We choose to donate our free time towards these humanitarian causes because we are confident that we can build the technology to help you realize your goals. **All we ask is your continued commitment towards us throughout the entire time we work together.**

Looking forward to working with you,
