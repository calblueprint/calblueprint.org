**[Cal Blueprint](http://www.calblueprint.org/)** is a student-run UC Berkeley organization devoted to matching the skills of its members to our desire to see social good enacted in our community. Each semester, teams of 4-5 students work closely with a non-profit to bring technological solutions to the problems they face every day.
