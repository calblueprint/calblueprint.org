      div.feature-title Online and Offline Attendance Taking
      div.feature-description DREAM's schools are located in areas where Wi-Fi can be very limited, so it is essential to be able to take attendance without an internet connection. We have digitalized and streamlined the entire process, removing the logistical overhead that may become roadblocks to students' effective education and learning.

      div.feature-title Mid-Semester Enrollments
      div.feature-description One case that often comes up in DREAM schools is the issue of mid-semester enrollments. Since students often drop in and out of DREAM programs, we wanted a way to easily enroll students into and unenroll students from their courses. The system is designed to be versatile enough that DREAM admins and teachers can easily search for existing students and alter their enrollment statuses, all within the mobile app.
