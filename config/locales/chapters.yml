      headline: Start a Blueprint Chapter
      subtitle:
        Blueprint was founded at UC Berkeley in Spring 2013. 
        Since then we started scaling our impact and further mission by establishing chapters in different colleges around the world.

        bridge: Bridge the gap between tech and non-profits. 
        bridge_description: >
          It’s true that non-profits lack technical resources to do their meaningful work. It’s also true that tech can’t solve global challenges. 
          Therefore, we are creating collaborative spaces both for NPOs and aspiring technologists to make positive changes together! 
        mark: Make a mark in your local community. 
        mark_description: > 
          Whether your university has a lot of clubs or not, you can be the one to bring accessible pathways for your community into technology that is inclusive and further 
          the mission for social impact at the same time!

      faq:
        q1:
          question: What kind of applications does Blueprint typically build?
          answer: >
            We develop web applications and mobile applications. 
            Blueprint typically built Rails applications with Postgres databases and React on the front-end, however, over time we have been changing tech stack based on NPO needs and Team Leads decisions. 
            Make sure to read  Technology Part in Project Leader Handbook and Developer Guide Tech that we send after onboarding to learn more!  Mobile applications are built natively for the desired platform. 
            The use of standardized frameworks helps developers switch between projects seamlessly and makes it easier for nonprofits to find developers to maintain the applications.
        q2:
          question: Why are projects taken on for one year?
          answer: >
            The year-long development cycle allows for a project to be completed, tested and deployed. Initially, Blueprint developed projects in a semester and found there was not enough time devoted to user testing and deployment. 
            Now, the first semester of the development cycle is devoted to user research, design, and developing the MVP application. The second semester is then used for user testing, refinement, and deployment of the project (handoff process to NPOs). 
        q3:
          question: How much time do members typically devote to Blueprint weekly?
          answer: >
            Members typically devote 9-12 hours a week to Cal Blueprint including general meetings and project team meetings. If the member is a project leader or in leadership they can expect to devote up to 15-20 hours a week to Cal Blueprint. 
            But, again it's up to each Chapter Leadership team to decide! 
        q4: 
          question: I am a senior at my school, but really want to start a chapter. How can I help / being involved?  
          answer: > 
            You can be an alumni and still establish the chapter. Just make sure that you found a team, who are still in the school! 
        q5: 
          question: How long does it take from establishing a chapter to the start of projects development?   
          answer: > 
            Usually it takes one semester to kick off the process, but it's up to you! It also depends on each university academic system and policies. 
            But we are here to help and resolve every roadblock you may encounter! 
        q6: 
          question: Are 5 projects required every year?   
          answer: > 
            No! Usually early stage chapters start with 2-3 projects to see how it's like:)
