      headline: Start a Blueprint Chapter
      subtitle:
        Blueprint was founded at UC Berkeley in Spring 2013. 
        Since then we started scaling our impact and further mission by establishing chapters in different colleges around the world.

        bridge: Bridge the gap between tech and non-profits. 
        bridge_description: >
          It’s true that non-profits lack technical resources to do their meaningful work. It’s also true that tech can’t solve global challenges. 
          Therefore, we are creating collaborative spaces both for NPOs and aspiring technologists to make positive changes together! 
        mark: Make a mark in your local community. 
        mark_description: > 
          Whether your university has a lot of clubs or not, you can be the one to bring accessible pathways to get into tech for a range of diverse voices. 
          We want to further our DEI efforts with you! 
        learn: Learn and grow. 
        learn_description: > 
          You and your peers can develop skills in software development, digital product design, event management, and so much more. 
          And all of this for a good cause!

      faq:
        q1:
          question: What kind of applications does Blueprint typically build?
          answer: >
            Blueprint typically builds Rails applications with Postgres databases and React on the front-end. 
            Mobile applications are built natively for the desired platform. 
            The use of standardized frameworks helps developers switch between projects seamlessly and makes it easier for nonprofits to find developers to maintain the applications. 
        q2:
          question: Why are projects taken on for one year?
          answer: >
            The year-long development cycle allows for a project to be completed, tested and deployed. Initially, Blueprint developed projects in a semester and found there was not enough time devoted to user testing and deployment. 
            Now, the first semester of the development cycle is devoted to developing the MVP application. The second semester is then used for user testing, refinement, and deployment of the project. 
        q3:
          question: How much time do members typically devote to Blueprint weekly?
          answer: >
            Members typically devote 9-12 hours a week to Blueprint including general meetings and project team meetings. 
            If the member is a project leader or in leadership they can expect to devote up to 15-20 hours a week to Blueprint.
