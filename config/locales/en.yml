            is delivered.
        q2:

            The team works alongside the client's vision for the organization. We hope that our project has
            significant impact on the organization's efficiency and reach, so the alignment of goals is
            crucial. At our meetings, we discuss updates on project features, check the timeline, and have
            discussion on the progress of the project and the nonprofit itself.
        q3:
          question: How does Blueprint ensure success?
          answer: >

            universities in computer science. Through effective leadership and frequent checkins with our
            clients we hope that the combination of talent, dedication, and care will result in a project that
