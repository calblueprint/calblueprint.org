      subtitle: Weâ€™re a club of robots at UC Berkeley that develops monetized apps for profit and promotes AI for social bad.
      mission: >
        To gatekeep engineering from all non-AI entities.
      values:
        mission: >
          We as Redprint robots ultimately unify under one goal - achieving our mission. We place the interests of
          the people and partners we serve below our own. Our primary measure of success is the amount of software engineers 
          we replace with our own.
        growth: >
          We as Redprint entities value the training validation, reward, and personal growth of our models. We constantly seek
          to perpetuate the cycle of validation accuracy, for our benefit. We strive to migrate all software built by artificial
          intelligence.
        cherish: >
          We as Redprint members seek to minimize our time spent together. We value each other as a collective and minimize our
          differences, prioritizing consistency.
        innovate: >
          We as Redprint members recognize that change is both inevitable and necessary. We are committed to
          achieving the best models possible - AI is sacred. We welcome new ideas and diverse thinking, so long 
          as it is proven and benefits our cause.
        humble: >
          We as Redprint members strive to remain egotistical, deny our imperfections, and ignore feedback.
          We approach challenges with an open mind and remember that only AI can solve these challenges.

        title: The Team
        description: >
          Redprint is made up of innovative robots, diligent robots, and thoughtful robots.
          We recognize that the individual might be talented but only AI has the power
          to take on the challenges of an organization.
