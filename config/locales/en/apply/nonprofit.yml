          Our written application portal opens. The application is split into two components
          with separate deadlines: the Interest Form and Project Proposal, described in detail below.
          If you have any questions or concerns please email
          <a href="mailto:team@calblueprint.org">team@calblueprint.org</a>.
        first_round: >
          The Interest Form is a short form for us to get to know your organization
          and mission better.
        second_round: >
          The Project Proposal is the second component of our written application that helps
          us understand what you need from Blueprint. You'll have the opportunity to explain
          why Blueprint's development services are important for your organization and provide
          specifics on what you'd like us to build with you.
        phone_screen: >
          A Phone Screen interview will allow you to introduce yourself in a call with our
          project leaders and get some questions answered about who we are and what we do.
          Our applications are reviewed as they are submitted, so your interviews may be
          scheduled before application deadlines.
        interviews: >
          In order to ensure project success, we conduct a final, comprehensive interview with
          you to better understand your project and if it's a fit for Blueprint.
          Check out our <a href="#criteria">decision criteria</a> below!
        final_decisions: >
          If selected to work with Blueprint, your organization will have the opportunity to work with
          us on a project over the course of a year. Once decisions are made, each project leader chooses an
          organization and we begin the journey!
      decision_criteria:
        description: >
          We want to help as many organizations as we possibly can. Unfortunately, we cannot take every
          project because of the large amount of resources each one requires. These are the primary criteria
          we use to determine project fit.

          Working with Blueprint has been an incredible pleasure. We have used their application to raise
          hundreds of thousands of dollars for Berkeley's teachers.

      faq:
        q1:
          question: How often do project teams and nonprofits meet?
          answer: >
            The client and the project leader meet on a weekly or biweekly basis to ensure the
            project’s progress. There are project scoping meetings with the project leader
            at the project start, a formal midpoint presentation, and a final presentation where the project
            is delivered.
        q2:
          question: What is the client-team interaction like?
          answer: >
            The team works alongside the client's vision for the organization. We hope that our project has
            significant impact on the organization's efficiency and reach, so the alignment of goals is
            crucial. At our meetings, we discuss updates on project features, check the timeline, and have
            discussion on the progress of the project and the nonprofit itself.
        q3:
          question: How does Blueprint ensure success?
          answer: >
            Our club recruits the brightest and most hard-working students at UC Berkeley, one of the best
            universities in computer science. Through effective leadership and frequent checkins with our
            clients we hope that the combination of talent, dedication, and care will result in a project that
            benefits your organization.
