        title: Frequently Asked Questions
        q1:
          question: What is Blueprint's project structure?
          answer: >
            Blueprint's project structure consists of 4-5 project teams, each with a project leader, a designer, 
            and 4 developers on the team. Each project team is in charge of creating technology resources
            for a specific non-profit they work with.
        q2:
          question: How are client team interactions conducted?
          answer: >
            The client and the project leader communicate on a weekly basis to ensure the
            projectâ€™s progress. Meetings occur throughout the project engagement, beginning with
            at least one mandatory project scoping meeting with the project leader at the onset.
            A formal midpoint presentation will be given in Week 5 of the engagement, and the final
            recommendation will be delivered at a final presentation in Week 10.
        q3:
          question: What resources does Blueprint have to ensure success?
          answer: >
            Our club recruits some of the most hard-working, passionate, and brightest students
            at UC Berkeley, just like you. Through effective leadership, frequent check-ins, and an
            organized project timeline set with our clients, we hope that the combination of talent,
            dedication, and care will result in projects that benefit the non-profits we work with.
