      faq:
        title: Frequently Asked Questions
        q1:
          question: What is Blueprint's structure?
          answer: >
            Blueprint's project structure consists of 4 project teams, each with a Project Leader, a designer, and 4-5 developers. Each project team is dedicated to one of our nonprofit and community partners and works closely with our points of contact to create equitable solutions through design and development.
            <br /><br />
            Blueprint’s External team consists of 6 directors and the External Vice President as the team lead. External works to inspire students outside of Cal Blueprint about creating change in communities and promoting public welfare through tech and design. This is done through public events, partnerships with mission-aligned organizations, new programs, and more. External, along with other project teams, are supported by an executive team of 7 students.
        q2:
          question: What are nonprofit and community partner relationships like?
          answer: >
            Our partners each have dedicated internal point(s) of contact who meet with our project teams on a regular
            (weekly or bi-weekly) basis. Because interactions vary based on partner capacity, timezones, internet access,
            and more, it's important to note that each partner relationship looks a little different. Broadly speaking,
            these meetings help ensure that our partners are on the same page as our project teams, and that the solutions
            we design and develop will actually be able to help the partner and communities in the best possible ways.
            <br /><br />
            At a more detailed level, we hold project scoping meeting(s) with each partner and their Project Leader at
            the start of the Fall semester to create a clear path for Blueprint is able to deliver. At the end of each
            semester, we hold a final meeting to present what was accomplished during the semester
            (and, in the case of fall, what will be accomplished in the spring).
        q3:
          question: What resources does Blueprint have to ensure success?
          answer: >
            Every member of Blueprint has several layers of formal support, including their project team members, their Project Leader, 
            and the executive team. To keep a pulse check on how members are feeling, leadership
            actively seeks out constructive feedback and holds periodic one-on-ones with members. We also guide all new developers
            and designers through our technical onboarding processes and make sure there is always space to ask for help,
            no matter how large or small the task. Project Leaders and our External Vice Presidet also ensure project success
            through organized timelines that make tasks and expectations as clear as possible throughout the semester.
            <br /><br />
            On top of everything, Blueprint is full of people who naturally want to help each other - on any given day or night,
            it's easy to find members squashing bugs together, holding informal critique sessions, DMing teammates for insight
            into other parts of Blueprint, or lending a listening ear.
            <br /><br />
            Even beyond college, our extensive alumni network remains in touch and are often continuing to give back to Blueprint 
            by sharing their post-graduation professional experiences.
