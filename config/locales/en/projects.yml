          The Problem
          -----------
          Every year, the schools fund would review hundreds of grant applications
          by hand in a very time consuming process. Grants would then only be
          awarded once a year for teachers, even though the teachers needed the
          funds throughout the year.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with the Schools Fund to create Friends and
          Family, a local crowdfunding platform for Berkeley School District
          teachers to utilize. With this new platform, teachers have been able to
          raise almost $30,000 thus far.

          The Problem
          -----------
          Project Homeless Connect runs approximately five events a year where they
          provide the homeless population of San Francisco with services such as
          hair cuts and wheelchair repairs. Every event the clients fill out a paper
          form with their personal information such as their SSN, and carry around a
          carbon copy during the event. This runs the risk of the client losing
          their carbon copy and exposing their personal information, while also
          accruing a large time debt for the organization to copy information from
          the paper form into their Salesforce CRM.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with Project Homeless Connect by developing an
          Android application that allowed clients to check in to the event. The
          application removed the cost of carbon copy paper, while adding the
          security of not carrying their personal information along with them, but
          rather a QR code associated with their information. The Android
          application also entered the data directly to their Salesforce CRM while
          reducing the number of duplicate entries, thus saving them countless hours
          of data entry every event.

          The Problem
          -----------
          ODALC aims to empower people with digital literacy education that will
          improve their lives and the communities they live in, but struggled with
          how to connect professionals in the tech and design industry with under
          resourced communities.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with ODALC to create a platform that seamlessly
          bridges technology, design and low-income communities. This platform
          serves to empower individuals to harness the digital tools to succeed in
          the 21st century.

          The Problem
          -----------
          Roots of Success strives to connect youth and adults from communities with
          high rates of poverty and unemployment to environmental careers and post-
          secondary education. With Roots of Success gaining more traction, it
          needed a way to efficiently manage more communities, teachers and
          students.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with Roots of Success to create a platform that
          allows teachers to gracefully manage multiple classrooms, modules and
          surveys.
