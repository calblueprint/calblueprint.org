          Our Project
          -----------
          A mobile application to help Our City Forest manage their tree inventory and visualize planted trees in the community. Each of their trees will have a unique QR code. Staff and volunteers can scan this code to view and modify the tree’s properties (whether it’s sick or healthy, its location, whether it’s been sold or planted, etc). Anyone from the general public can scan a tree or shrub’s QR code to see its information and care guide. The app will also include a map to display the locations of the trees Our City Forest has planted in their community. This will both help them maintain these trees and measure their impact while applying to grants.

          The Problem
          -----------
          1951 Coffee runs two-week long training programs that teach students the essential skills to be successful in barista roles. During this program, individual texting makes up 80-90% of communications with trainees. 1951 Coffee is in need for a central, scaleable method for administrators to communicate with its trainees and graduates with limited technology experience.

          The Solution
          -----------
          Blueprint developed a mobile communication platform to connect 1951 Coffee's staff and alumni. This mobile application features ways to display internal announcements, job postings, events, and resources — an essential tool for information and forming digital community.

          The Problem
          -----------
          Healthy Corners provides many benefits to their customers, but since they operate in partnership with the 50+ stores in their network, the Healthy Corners team lacked a direct channel of communication with the customers they serve. Healthy Corners needed a new customer engagement strategy that would allow the team to serve customers more directly.

          The Solution
          -----------
          Blueprint developed a customer rewards program to give Healthy Corners a direct channel to engage and serve their customers.  This includes a [customer-facing mobile app](https://tiny.cc/HealthyCornersApp) with a store and product locator, as well as a [tablet app for store clerks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.calblueprint.HealthyCornersClerk) to record purchases and points to redeem free produce rewards.

          People Power Solar Cooperative is building a movement toward expanding access to affordable 
          residential solar power in California. To do so, they crowdsource investments from low-income 
          communities to install solar panels on homes and then distribute any revenue generated by the 
          solar panels back to the community as dividend. By implementing this novel community-owned 
          revenue-sharing model, People Power is on a mission to uplift communities using the power of renewable energy.

          The Problem
          -----------
          People Power Solar Cooperative is leading the way to a just, community-led future with renewable energy. They provide the financial, logistical, and legal backbone for communities to organize and invest in community solar. Facilitating this process and providing transparency into the cooperative for all invested owners is difficult to manage and does not scale well. 

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint developed a platform that lets people sign on and begin investing in the cooperative. Owners of the cooperative can use it to  track their investments, keep up to date with news, and see their impact. This will help PPSC scale quickly and help support more communities!

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Re-Plate currently acts as a middleman for all transactions and relies on a
          fleet of drivers to ship food around. As they scale, Re-Plate needs a more direct
          system for donors and recipients to communicate with each other.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s team is developing an online marketplace for food donations. This
          system will allow anybody with surplus food — not just businesses — to post a
          donation and for nearby recipients to claim the donation. Re-Plate’s staff would be
          able to facilitate the process and monitor the marketplace. Through this system,
          Re-Plate doesn’t have to manually track each donation, which would allow them to
          scale to cities across the US and potentially feed thousands of additional individuals.

          -----------
          Blueprint is creating a React Native mobile application for DREAM to help teachers manage their classes, students, and attendances offline.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Currently, veterans are provided hard copy resources which are easy to lose track of and they have a hard time connecting to each other and to the rest of society. Veteran organizations are not able to connect veterans early enough in order to avoid crises as they can only reach them when veterans call in for help.  The more Veterans 360 grows, the more important it becomes for them to maintain a centralized digital collection of resources that veterans can come back to as well as connect veterans to each other and to helpful organizations early on in order to prevent crises.

          The Solution
          -----------
          Blueprint is working with Veterans 360 to create a web platform that allows Veterans 360 and partnering organizations to provide resources and support to these veterans. In order to help veterans have access to this information immediately, at any time and place, Blueprint has also created a mobile application through which veterans can read these resources and connect with other veterans and organizations in their area.

        full_description: |
          The Problem
          -----------
          Few other colleges teach data science as an intro course, not because the content is challenging
          so much as because the student set-up time is so high. Many packages and tools — such as Jupyter,
          Pandas, and Matplotlib —need to be configured for students to adequately learn key concepts.
          This presents a serious barrier to entry for non-technical students.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s project team will be creating a new deployment system that is easy for other classes
          and universities to use. This new system will deploy in one step with minimal configuration. be
          easily monitored for traffic and errors, and work across multiple cloud providers, including Google
          Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services. Blueprint’s completed application will potentially

          manage to do everything manually, including accepting applications, matching up suitable
          teachers with students, and scheduling individual music lessons.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint’s Forte team will build a web application to help automate a large part of this
          process. This web application will include an application system for interested students and
          teachers, a scheduling dashboard for students and teachers to see upcoming and past lessons,

          Every year, the schools fund would review hundreds of grant applications

          awarded once a year for teachers, even though the teachers needed the
          funds throughout the year.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with the Schools Fund to create Friends and
          Family, a local crowdfunding platform for Berkeley School District
          teachers to utilize. With this new platform, teachers have been able to

          Project Homeless Connect runs approximately five events a year where they
          provide the homeless population of San Francisco with services such as
          hair cuts and wheelchair repairs. Every event the clients fill out a paper
          form with their personal information such as their SSN, and carry around a
          carbon copy during the event. This runs the risk of the client losing
          their carbon copy and exposing their personal information, while also
          accruing a large time debt for the organization to copy information from
          the paper form into their Salesforce CRM.

          The Solution
          ------------
          Blueprint was able to work with Project Homeless Connect by developing an
          Android application that allowed clients to check in to the event. The
          application removed the cost of carbon copy paper, while adding the
          security of not carrying their personal information along with them, but
          rather a QR code associated with their information. The Android
          application also entered the data directly to their Salesforce CRM while
          reducing the number of duplicate entries, thus saving them countless hours
          of data entry every event.
