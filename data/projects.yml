    Every year, the schools fund would review hundreds of grant applications
    by hand in a very time consuming process. Grants would then only be
    awarded once a year for teachers, even though the teachers needed the
    funds throughout the year.

    Blueprint was able to work with the Schools Fund to create Friends and
    Family, a local crowdfunding platform for Berkeley School District
    teachers to utilize. With this new platform, teachers have been able to
    raise almost $30,000 thus far.

    Project Homeless Connect runs approximately five events a year where they
    provide the homeless population of San Francisco with services such as
    hair cuts and wheelchair repairs. Every event the clients fill out a paper
    form with their personal information such as their SSN, and carry around a
    carbon copy during the event. This runs the risk of the client losing
    their carbon copy and exposing their personal information, while also
    accruing a large time debt for the organization to copy information from
    the paper form into their Salesforce CRM.

    Blueprint was able to work with Project Homeless Connect by developing an
    Android application that allowed clients to check in to the event. The
    application removed the cost of carbon copy paper, while adding the
    security of not carrying their personal information along with them, but
    rather a QR code associated with their information. The Android
    application also entered the data directly to their Salesforce CRM while
    reducing the number of duplicate entries, thus saving them countless hours
    of data entry every event.

    improve their lives and the communities they live in, but struggled with
    how to connect professionals in the tech and design industry with under
    resourced communities.

    Blueprint was able to work with ODALC to create a platform that seamlessly
    bridges technology, design and low-income communities. This platform
    serves to empower individuals to harness the digital tools to succeed in
    the 21st century.

    Roots of Success strives to connect youth and adults from communities with
    high rates of poverty and unemployment to environmental careers and post-
    secondary education. With Roots of Success gaining more traction, it
    needed a way to efficiently manage more communities, teachers and
    students.

    Blueprint was able to work with Roots of Success to create a platform that
    allows teachers to gracefully manage multiple classrooms, modules and
    surveys.
